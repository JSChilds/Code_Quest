		<h1>A Trendy Office</h1>
		<main>
			<p>The metal door to the <strong>SOUTH</strong> slides shut, nearly crushing you (told you).</p>
			<p>You're in a hip, open-plan office. Everything looks sleek and up-to-date.</p>
			<p>In the corner of the room is a large <strong>WHITEBOARD</strong> and a <strong>SIGN</strong>.
			<p>In the middle of the room is a table with a sleek <strong>LAPTOP</strong> on it.</p>
			<p>It looks like there is more of the office to the <strong>NORTH</strong>.</p>
			<p>This place looks fancy, but weirdly soulless. Huh.</p>
			<p>What will you do?</p>
